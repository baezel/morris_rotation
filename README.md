# morris_rotation
A public repository hosting a final script the Lactuca sativa gene regulatory network project I worked on in Richard Morris' lab.

minimise_final corresponds to the Pink et al. 2024 project, and should work, though admittedly needs tidied. The myrchar work corresponds to the paper, "Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Is Negatively and Positively Regulated by Calcium, Providing a Mechanism for Decoding Calcium Responses during Symbiosis Signaling", (Miller et al., 2013), of which I tried to recapitulate the model described of calcium waves in legume root hair nodulation. In short, I did not achieve this, and so neither of those scripts are functioning, however have been uploaded for the records.
